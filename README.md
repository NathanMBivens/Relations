# Relations
A Python script which reads a .txt file, then determines a relation's properties, its Boolean matrix representation, and its closure sets.

Example Input
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
{(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 2), (7, 7)}

Example Output
Relation1.txt Information
S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
R: Sâ†’S = {(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 7), (3, 1), (3, 3), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5), (5, 6), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 2), (7, 7)}

The properties of the relation:
Reflexive                     	True
Irreflexive                   	False
Symmetric                     	True
Asymmetric                    	False
Antisymmetric                 	False
Transitive                    	True
Equivalence Relation          	True
Partial Ordering              	False

Reflexive Closure: {}
Symmetric Closure: {}
